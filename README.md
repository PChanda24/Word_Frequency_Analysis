# Keyword and Tweet Analysis

## Project Overview
The project is divided into two main tasks:
### Task 1: Keyword Network Analysis
**Objective: Transform keyword data into a weighted network and analyze its structure.**
**Steps involved and their significance:**
1. Extract keyword data from the provided dataset and convert it to a weighted adjacency matrix.
2. Convert the adjacency matrix into a weighted network.
3. Compute node degree and strength.
4. Identify the top nodes by degree and strength.
5. Identify the top node pairs by weight, highlighting significant relationships in the network.
6. Visualize the relationship between node degree and average strength, providing insights into the network's structural properties.

### Task 2: Twitter Data Analysis (2017-2022)
**Objective: Analyze word frequencies in Elon Musk's tweets and apply network and statistical analyses.**
**Steps involved and their significance:**
1. Compute word frequencies for each year, excluding stop words.
2. Identify the top 10 words for each year by word frequency, showcasing key topics and trends in Elon Musk's tweets.
3. Plot histograms of word frequencies for each year for visual comparison across years.
4. Apply Zipf’s law and generate log-log plots of word frequencies and rank for each year, demonstrating the distribution and ranking of word frequencies.
5. Create bigram network graphs for each year, illustrating the connections between frequently co-occurring words.
